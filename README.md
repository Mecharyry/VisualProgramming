=================

Visual based solution for creating program source code. (POC)

PREREQUISITES
In order to run the application your computer requires the .Net framework to be installed, this will automatically be downloaded when attempting to run the application if you do not already have it.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
To run the application please navigate to:
WpfApplication3\bin\Release\
And then run the WpfApplication3.exe file / application

FUNCTIONALITY
-	Two controls have currently been implemented.
  o	For loop
    	Consists of navigating through all worksheets
    	All other functions associated with this for loop are dummy only and will not produce any source code
  o	Excel Connection
-	Save and load functionality

Although the functionality is limited it must be noted that this is a proof of concept only.
